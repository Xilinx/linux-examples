sdfec-interrupts Example Application
====================================

The example processor application is used to demonstrate how to configure
the SD-FEC IP instance(s) for interrupt usage with the Linux SDFEC driver.
SDFEC is set to work in Non-5G operational mode with LDPC coding.

The example was tested and built with PETALINUX version 2019.1 for xilinx
board zcu111.


How to apply, build and run the example APP in a petalinux project
==================================================================
1. Copy folder sdfec-interrupts to a petalinux eg. from the root of
the repo do:
cp -r ./sd-fec-1.1/sdfec-interrupts <petalinux-proj>/project-spec/meta-user/recipes-apps

2. Build petalinux project and upload images to a target platform.

3. Run the example APP as "sdfec-interrupts".

4. The example APP runs to completion and returns:
        0 on success
        -1 on failure
