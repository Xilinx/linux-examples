 * @brief	SDFEC User Interface Header
 *
 * @details
 * This header provides the definitions for the User Interface to control the
 * SDFEC Engine Instance.
 *
 * The Xilinx FEC SDFEC Engine is a hard IP designed for Xilinx FPGAs and SOCs
 * and the contains the following general features :
 *	- Support for LDPC and Turbo Codes
 *	- 32 bit wide AXI based register interface
 *
 * This API utilizes a 32 bit AXI MMIO interface to the FEC registers.
 * All interfaces described below are implemented in sdfec_usr_intf.c
 *
 * The user interface provided here performs device initialisation,
 * loading of appropriate codes, starting and stopping the SDFEC device
 * via IOCTL calls.
 *
 * The SDFEC IP is intended to be delivered as a part of a MP-SoC offering.
 * The  is expected to be built and compiled by means of a PetaLinux app.
 *
