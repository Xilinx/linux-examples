sdfec-demo Example Application
==============================

The example processor application is used to set up and control the BER test
HW and demonstrates how to configure and use the SD-FEC IP instance(s) using
the Linux SDFEC driver.
SDFEC is set to work in Non-5G operational mode with LDPC coding.

The example was tested and built with PETALINUX version 2019.1 for xilinx
board zcu111.


How to apply, build and run the example APP in a petalinux project
==================================================================
1. Copy folder sdfec-demo to a petalinux eg. from the root of
the repo do:
cp -r ./sd-fec-1.1/sdfec-demo <petalinux-proj>/project-spec/meta-user/recipes-apps

2. Build petalinux project and upload images to a target platform.

3. Run the example APP as "sdfec-demo".

4. The example APP runs to completion and returns:
        0 on success
        -1 on failure
